# Tulip UML Editor

Tulip is a UML editor based on Johan Rosengren's UML Editor posted on CodeProject (see https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7552/UMLEditor-revisiting-the-vector-editor).

My motivation for this project was to teach myself MFC, and to see how much has changed in MFC over the years. I hope you find the code useful!
